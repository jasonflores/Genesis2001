              <h1>About Genesis 2001</h1>

              <p>
              Those who may have an interest in this website would have an affinity for science and the following precepts:
              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>We believe in God.</strong>   We believe God was before the beginning and God will be after the end.  We can not define God, because we were defined by God.
              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>We believe God created the universe in all it's infinity:</strong>  all that there was, all that there is, and all that there ever will be.  We believe this universe exists only by the magnificence of God.
              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>We believe in God.   We worship God.</strong>  Man has an imperfect conception of God.  God is greater than man's perception.  We seek to be a part of the body of God.  We believe the power of God is beyond human comprehension.
              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>We believe the Kingdom of God lies in the hearts of Gods people of faith</strong>.  We believe prophets of God provided inspired scriptures for prayer & meditation.   All women & men in meditation & prayer who seek God with all of their hearts, minds & souls will find God.  We believe Jesus provided the two commandments:   "Believe in God with all your heart, and the second: love your neighbor as you love yourself".
              </p>

              <div class="row evenSpacedColumns padding-top-bottom-15">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <img src="/images/aboutUs1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <img src="/images/aboutUs2.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <img src="/images/aboutUs3.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>
              <strong>We believe these commandments reveal the will of God</strong>, and anyone following these two commandments will build a better world and please God.
              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>We know that historically Jesus lived & preached along the shores of Gallellie</strong>.  He was revered for his wisdom, knowledge, and healing.  He challenged the temple leaders, was arrested for his beliefs, was examined by the Roman Pilate, and was ultimately crucified and buried in a tomb.  We know the bible confirms he was raised again and walked among Peter, James, and 500 witnesses.   By faith we accept the gift of God of forgiveness of our sins through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus the Christ.
              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>We believe science confirms faith in a Devine Universe</strong>.  We believe in testable scientific hypothesis, and we question science results that skirt this rigorous process to construct essentially theological assumptions camouflaged as "scientific fact".  Evolution is a prime case in point.  While many of the observed animal processes today along with archeological evidence points to species enhancement over eons; fundamental facts such as the spontaneous initiation of life can neither be scientifically validated today nor observed from archeological findings.  It is therefore not "fact" as scientists today claim, but a working hypothesis that can never be proven.
              </p>

              <p>
              This is in essence the fundamental purpose of this website:  to navigate between true science and clarify where science takes the faith leap to its own "atheistic religion".
              </p>
