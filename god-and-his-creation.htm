              <h1>
              God & His Creation in the 21st Century
              </h1>  

              <p>
              Reality:  The Science of God
              </p>  

              <p>
              In the beginning, there was God.   This we know because - out of nothing we exist.   Matter is mostly space just as the universe is mostly space.  We then are essentially an illusion of gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong & weak nuclear forces.  The periodic table describes the elements of matter.  But - in reality - we are an illusion of matter, space & time.  And so, God is the Creator!  This is actually intuitive and logical.
              </p>  

              <p>
              If in fact we are the result of a "big bang", then again we are but an illusion. For an explosion of all that exists from the size of a fraction of an atom to larger than a galaxy in a split second violates all known physics.  Quantum mechanics is an interesting field of study, but unless God chooses to reveal Himself to us, we will never explain it ourselves.  We can hypothesize and then more or less "vote" on the most popular theory, but the "reality of existence" in this universe will ultimately remain known only unto God.
              </p>  

              <p>
              So we are an illusion, and even if we choose to say "there is no God", its simply one theory among hundreds that say God exists (or not).  All are based on faith including atheism.  Let us for once be totally honest about God: whether God exists, what ever form He exists - in reality God has chosen to leave us in the "illusion of life" unto which each of us were born.
              </p>  

              <p>
              Reality: The Faith of God
              </p>  

              <p>
              Despite the fact that we are but an illusion, we have various senses: sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste, and "faith".   Animals have various senses.  Some can see in the dark, by sound, or infra red spectrum.  But ultimately all living things have some variations of our own senses.  If there is no "faith sense" then why would we speculate?   It is unlikely that animals speculate on this - so why are we humans so special.
              </p>  

              <p>
              If no creature that ever existed had sight, would we speculate on what we cannot see?  Not likely.  We have faith as a sense just as surely as we have ears to hear.   Most creatures do not appear to have the sense of "faith".  Yet throughout recorded history and even before, humans have speculated on the creation.  There are 40,000 year old cave paintings that attest to human's having "faith" of some sort.
              </p>  

              <p>
              Despite the fact that we are in reality an illusion, it is an illusion with three space dimensions and one time dimension.  We know length, width, height, and time.  Since about 1500, we have experienced 500 years of fabulous growth in knowledge only to come back to much of what other civilizations knew 2500 years ago.  The Earth is round and can be measured.  We learned other great things in this 500 years, but the four space/time dimensions were all known by the ancients.
              </p>  

              <p>
              So we now speculate on evolution & a Big Bang.  Scientists around the world voted for it (published papers), and in so doing, they implicitly and explicitly voted out God.   But they can no more prove God doesn't exist than they can prove God does exist.
              </p>  

              <p>
              What arrogance is this for science to assert that there is no God!
              </p>  

              <p>
              What ignorance by the rest of us to believe them!
              </p>
